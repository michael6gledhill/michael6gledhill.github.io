## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

Hi, I'm **Michael Gledhill**, Cadet Commander at Civil Air Patrol's Heartland Composite Squadron. I lead and mentor 30+ cadets while managing training programs and emergency services operations. As a 3D printer repair specialist, I reduced equipment downtime by 30% and resolved 100+ technical issues for medical device production. I'm a certified student pilot with 15+ solo hours. I combine leadership, technical expertise, and operational discipline to drive mission-focused results.
