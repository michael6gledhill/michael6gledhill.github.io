## Elevator Speech

I am the **Cadet Commander** of Civil Air Patrol's Heartland Composite Squadron, leading 30+ cadets in leadership development, aviation operations, and emergency services. With a **Cadet Captain** rank achieved through consistent advancement and the Mitchell Award for honor credit, I have completed three encampments and three National Cadet Special Activities. As a **CyberPatriot Team Captain and two-time National Semifinalist**, I combine technical expertise with aviation proficiency. I have completed my **Powered Solo Wings** and logged 9 hours toward my pilot rating. My goal is to become a U.S. Air Force pilot while continuing to serve as a mentor and leader.
