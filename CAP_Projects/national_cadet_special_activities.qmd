## Introduction

National Cadet Special Activities (NCSAs) are advanced, week-long or multi-week programs designed to give cadets hands-on experience in leadership, aviation, aerospace, STEM, and emergency services. These programs allow cadets to expand their skills, network with peers nationwide, and experience specialized training beyond the squadron and encampment level. NCSAs represent some of the highest-level training opportunities available within the Civil Air Patrol cadet program.
