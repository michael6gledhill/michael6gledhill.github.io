# About My Civil Air Patrol Experience

I have been a member of the Civil Air Patrol for two and a half years and currently serve as the **Cadet Commander** of the Heartland Composite Squadron. I hold the rank of **Cadet Captain**, and I advanced on time every two months all the way up through my current grade.

I completed my basic encampment in Florida during the 2022–2023 cycle, and I have since attended a total of **three encampments and three National Cadet Special Activities**. My time in CAP has focused on leadership development, aviation, emergency services, and guiding cadets through structured, mission-driven training.
